 * Created by Mehmet AKGUL on 9/11/23.
 *
 * Sophia is playing a game on the computer. There are two random arrays A & B, each having the same number of elements. The game begins with Sophia removing a pair (Ai, Bj) from the array if they are not co-prime. She keeps a count on the number of times this operation is done.
 * Sophia wants to find out the maximal number of times(S) she can do this on the arrays. Could you help Sophia find the value?
 * Input Format
 * The first line contains an integer n. 2 lines follow, each line containing n numbers separated by a single space. The format is shown below.
 * n
 * A[0] A[1] ... A[n - 1]
 * B[0] B[1] ... B[n - 1]
 * Constraints
 * 0 < n <= 105
 * 2 <= A[i], B[i] <= 109
 * Each element in both arrays are generated randomly between 2 and 109
 * Output Format
 * Output S which is the maximum number of times the above operation can be made.
 * Sample Input
 * 4
 * 2 5 6 7
 * 4 9 10 12
